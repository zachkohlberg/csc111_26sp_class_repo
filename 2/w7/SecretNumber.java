/**
 * You don't need to read this code, and you MUST NOT edit it. All of your changes should be made to
 * the GuessBot program. All you need to know about SecretNumber is the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Upon creation, it chooses a secret int from 1 to 1 billion.
 *   <li>You can call .isGreaterThan(x) to ask whether the secret int is greater than x.
 *   <li>You can call .guessSecret(x) ONLY ONCE to guess that the secret number is x.
 *   <li>It will only accept numbers from 1 to 1 billion.
 *   <li>Correct usage is demonstrated by GuessBot.java.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>I felt like using javadoc comments in this code, which is why you see some html tags. You can
 * use the javadoc program (included with your jdk installation) to generate a documentation website
 * for this class.
